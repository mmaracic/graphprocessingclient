#executing query
#Cypher() executes the cypher query passed as an argument.

#Cypher may not be used as part of an expression, use a subquery instead.
#Calling Cypher in the SELECT clause as an independent column is not allowed. However Cypher may be used when it belongs as a conditional.

#Example
#SELECT * FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
#/* Cypher Query Here */

#Sample1
